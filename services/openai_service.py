    3. Select at least 5 and at most 20 options.
    
    ---
    
    ###  Output Requirements

    2. For each selected element:
       - Keep all original fields (`id`, `type`, `lat`, `lon`, `tags`, etc.).
       - Add one extra field:
         ```
         "description": "A short one-sentence summary describing the place."
         ```
    3. Do **not** alter the format or nesting of the elements.
    4. The output must be a **valid JSON list of dictionaries** ‚Äî no markdown, no text before or after.
